        <h6 style="color: #c68e17; font-weight: 600;">1. Introduction to KuraSmart</h6>
        <p>
          KuraSmart is a secure, cloud-based voting platform built to modernize and streamline elections.

        </p>

        <h6 style="color: #c68e17; font-weight: 600;">2. Who Uses KuraSmart?</h6>
        <p>
          - Educational Institutions (student council elections, class reps)<br>
          - Clubs and Societies (e.g., university unions, church groups)<br>
          - NGOs, Cooperatives, and Associations<br>
          - Corporate teams and staff-based voting<br>
          - Event-based voting (hackathons, innovation awards)
        </p>

        <h6 style="color: #c68e17; font-weight: 600;">3. Setting Up an Election</h6>
        <p>
          Administrators begin by creating an election. They set the voting dates, rules (anonymous or open), and positions. Each position can have one or more candidates. You can upload candidates manually or through bulk import tools (CSV or Google Sheets).
        </p>

        <h6 style="color: #c68e17; font-weight: 600;">4. Adding Voters Securely</h6>
        <p>
          Voters can be added in bulk using email addresses, phone numbers, or student IDs. Each voter receives a unique token or login credentials, ensuring that only eligible participants can vote, and only once. Voter data is encrypted and protected.
        </p>

        <h6 style="color: #c68e17; font-weight: 600;">5. Voting Experience</h6>
        <p>
          Voting on KuraSmart is intuitive and mobile-friendly. Voters:
          <ul>
            <li>Log in with a secure link or code</li>
            <li>View available positions and candidate bios</li>
            <li>Vote privately and submit their choices with a click</li>
          </ul>
          Each vote is encrypted and anonymized to ensure privacy.
        </p>

        <h6 style="color: #c68e17; font-weight: 600;">6. Real-Time Monitoring</h6>
        <p>
          Election organizers can track turnout and participation in real time without seeing who voted for whom. This helps improve transparency and accountability while preventing manipulation.
        </p>

        <h6 style="color: #c68e17; font-weight: 600;">7. Fraud Prevention and Security</h6>

        </p>

        <h6 style="color: #c68e17; font-weight: 600;">8. Announcing Results</h6>
        <p>

          <ul>
            <li>Candidate-wise vote counts</li>
            <li>Charts and analytics</li>
            <li>Exportable PDFs and CSVs for records</li>
          </ul>
          This eliminates the need for manual counting or third-party verification.
        </p>

        <h6 style="color: #c68e17; font-weight: 600;">9. Post-Election Reports & Archiving</h6>
        <p>
          After elections, all data (votes, turnout, results) is securely archived. Admins can revisit past elections, view historical trends, or prepare audits. Archived data is encrypted and cannot be altered.
        </p>

        <h6 style="color: #c68e17; font-weight: 600;">10. Accessibility & Mobile Support</h6>
